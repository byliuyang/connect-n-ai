The compared two evaluation functions. 
The first function looking for consecutive block in line for scores.
The second function looking for number of blocks in line for scores.

The second approach tends to have better moves.

Due to the time is not sufficient to implement more evaluations scoring algorithms, I havenâ€™t finished more testings that I have proposed.
